# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've made a javascript snippet for counting HTML element on the page. I also did a password strength component using vue.js.

**Thoughts:** I tried to make a reduce pipeline but convert into object keys was more performatic.

### Day 1: April 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
