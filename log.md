# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've made a javascript snippet for counting HTML element on the page. I also did a password strength component using vue.js.

**Thoughts:** I tried to make a reduce pipeline but convert into object keys was more performatic.

### Day 1: April 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I helped a vue community member to solve a little beginner issue. I refactored the password strength component and created a scrollTop new component.

**Thoughts:** People copy internet code and don't spend any time trying to undersatand the code objective.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
